        <h1>Measuring Carbon Emissions in Web Development</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to our research project exploring the environmental impact
          of popular web development frameworks. In this study, we aim to
          evaluate and compare the carbon emissions generated by websites
          built using different frameworks such as JavaScript, Angular, React,
          and Vue. As the digital landscape evolves, understanding the
          ecological footprint of web development becomes crucial. Join us in
          uncovering insights that contribute to more sustainable practices in
          the world of technology.
